# FPrimeCfs::CfsAppBridge

An app-layer bridge placed at the head of a framing chain, in place of `Svc.ComQueue`. It accepts either a cFS
command (function code plus payload buffer) or an F Prime com buffer, and emits the data with a populated
`ComCfg.FrameContext` on a single buffer + context output feeding the framer chain (e.g. `CfsCmdFramer` or
`CfsTlmFramer` ahead of `Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketFramer`).

## Usage

Command sending instance:

```
[command source].cfsCommandOut -> CfsAppBridge.cfsCommandIn
CfsAppBridge.dataOut -> CfsCmdFramer.dataIn
CfsCmdFramer.dataReturnOut -> CfsAppBridge.dataReturnIn
CfsAppBridge.bufferReturnOut -> [command source's buffer return input]
```

Telemetry instance (packetizer, events, telemetry channels):

```
[packetizer / eventManager / tlmChan].PktSend/comOut -> CfsAppBridge.comIn[i]
CfsAppBridge.dataOut -> CfsTlmFramer.dataIn
CfsTlmFramer.dataReturnOut -> CfsAppBridge.dataReturnIn
```

Both instances connect `bufferAllocate` / `bufferDeallocate` to a buffer manager.

## APID selection

- `cfsCommandIn`: the APID is configured once via `configure(commandApid)`; the function code from the port call
  is set in the context's `functionCode` field (added by this library's `ComCfg.fpp` configuration override) for
  `CfsCmdFramer` to place in the cFS command secondary header.
- `comIn`: the leading `FwPacketDescriptorType` packet descriptor is read from the com buffer and mapped to the
  corresponding `ComCfg.Apid` value (descriptors coincide with the `FW_PACKET_*` APID values). An unreadable or
  unknown descriptor forwards the data with `FW_PACKET_UNKNOWN` and an `UnknownDescriptor` warning event.

## Buffer ownership

Both inputs copy the incoming data into a buffer allocated via `bufferAllocate`:

- `cfsCommandIn` buffers are returned to the sender on `bufferReturnOut` before the handler returns.
- `comIn` receives `Fw::ComBuffer` by value; no return is needed.
- Buffers coming back on `dataReturnIn` are deallocated via `bufferDeallocate`.
- If allocation fails (undersized buffer), the data is dropped with an `AllocationFailed` warning event and any
  non-empty allocation is deallocated.

Unlike `Svc.ComQueue`, this component does not queue or pace transmission on communication status; data is
forwarded as it arrives.
