# FPrimeCfs::CfsRouter

Routes packets deframed by an `Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketDeframer` to the rest of the system. `CfsRouter` replaces
`Svc.FprimeRouter` in a cFS-hosted topology: F Prime commands are copied and forwarded to a command dispatcher as
`Svc.FprimeRouter` does, while cFS commands and telemetry are forwarded on custom ports carrying the fields of their
cFS secondary headers (function code, or time) together with the payload. Packets with no configured route are
forwarded to an unknown output.

## Usage

```
CfsBridge.dataOut -> Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketDeframer.dataIn
Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketDeframer.dataOut -> CfsRouter.dataIn
CfsRouter.dataReturnOut -> Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketDeframer.dataReturnIn
CfsRouter.commandOut[i] -> [command dispatcher].seqCmdBuff
CfsRouter.cfsCommandOut[j] / cfsTelemetryOut[k] / unknownDataOut -> [cFS-aware consumers]
[consumers' buffer return] -> CfsRouter.bufferReturnIn
```

Routing is selected by a static APID routing table configured in `config/CfsRouterConfig/CfsRouterCfg.fpp`.
Projects override this file (via `register_fprime_config` `CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDES`) to supply their own table,
table size, port-array sizes, and pending-buffer limit:

```
constant CFS_ROUTER_ROUTE_TABLE_SIZE = 3
constant CFS_ROUTER_ROUTE_TABLE = [
    { apid = ComCfg.Apid.FW_PACKET_COMMAND, routeType = CfsRouteType.FPRIME_COMMAND, portIndex = 0 },
    { apid = ComCfg.Apid.SOME_CFS_CMD_APID, routeType = CfsRouteType.CFS_COMMAND,    portIndex = 0 },
    { apid = ComCfg.Apid.SOME_CFS_TLM_APID, routeType = CfsRouteType.CFS_TELEMETRY,  portIndex = 0 },
]
```

The route entry type (`CfsRouteEntry`), route type enumeration (`CfsRouteType`), and time type (`CfsTime`) are
defined in the `Types` module (`Types/CfsRouterTypes.fpp`); the `CfsCommand` and `CfsTelemetry` port types are
defined in the common `FPrimeCfs/Ports` module.

Note: any cFS APID to be routed must also be present in the project's `ComCfg.Apid` enumeration, since the
`Svc.Ccsds.SpacePacketDeframer` maps APIDs not in the enumeration to `INVALID_UNINITIALIZED` (which then takes the
unknown route).

## Secondary headers

- cFS command secondary header (2 bytes): `{U8 FunctionCode, U8 Checksum}`. The function code is forwarded on
  `cfsCommandOut`; the payload is the data after the secondary header.
- cFS telemetry secondary header (6 bytes, big-endian): 4-byte seconds followed by 2-byte subseconds (the most
  significant 16 bits of the 2^-32 subseconds value). Forwarded on `cfsTelemetryOut` as a `CfsTime`
  (`seconds: U32`, `subseconds: U32`); the payload is the data after the secondary header.
- F Prime commands framed with a cFS command header carry the 2-byte command secondary header ahead of the
  F Prime command data; it is excluded from the copied data when the context indicates one is present.

## Buffer ownership

- F Prime command route: the packet data is copied into an `Fw::ComBuffer`; the incoming buffer is returned to the
  sender on `dataReturnOut` immediately. This is the only route that copies.
- cFS command, cFS telemetry, and unknown routes: ownership of the (payload) buffer transfers to the receiver, and
  returns on `bufferReturnIn`, which forwards it to `dataReturnOut`.
- Buffers are always returned on `dataReturnOut` with the context they were received with. For pass-through routes
  the router records the buffer-to-context association in a map (capacity `CFS_ROUTER_MAX_PENDING_BUFFERS`); if the
  map is full, the packet is returned unrouted with a warning event.
- If the target output port for a computed route is not connected, the buffer is returned immediately rather than
  asserting or leaking.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-001 | CfsRouter shall select a route for each message received on `dataIn` using a statically configured APID to (route type, port index) routing table. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-002 | CfsRouter shall route messages whose APID is configured as `FPRIME_COMMAND` to the configured F Prime command output port by copying the packet data into an `Fw::ComBuffer`. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-003 | CfsRouter shall route messages whose APID is configured as `CFS_COMMAND` to the configured cFS command output port, providing the function code (`U8`) parsed from the cFS command secondary header and the payload buffer. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-004 | CfsRouter shall route messages whose APID is configured as `CFS_TELEMETRY` to the configured cFS telemetry output port, providing the time parsed from the 6-byte big-endian cFS telemetry secondary header and the payload buffer. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-005 | CfsRouter shall route any message whose APID is not present in the routing table to the unknown data output port with its context. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-006 | CfsRouter shall route messages configured as `CFS_COMMAND` or `CFS_TELEMETRY` whose context indicates no secondary header, or whose data is too small to contain the secondary header, to the unknown data output port and emit a warning event. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-007 | For `FPRIME_COMMAND` routing, CfsRouter shall exclude the cFS command secondary header from the copied data when the context indicates one is present. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-008 | For `FPRIME_COMMAND` routing, CfsRouter shall return ownership of the received buffer to the sender immediately after copying. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-009 | For `CFS_COMMAND`, `CFS_TELEMETRY`, and unknown routing, CfsRouter shall transfer buffer ownership to the receiver and return ownership to the sender only after the buffer is returned on `bufferReturnIn`. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-010 | CfsRouter shall complete every buffer ownership transfer by eventually returning the received buffer to the sender on `dataReturnOut`. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-011 | CfsRouter shall emit a warning-severity event when packet data cannot be copied into a command buffer. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-012 | When the target output port for a computed route is not connected, CfsRouter shall return the received buffer to the sender rather than assert or leak. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-013 | CfsRouter shall accept command responses on `cmdResponseIn` as a no-op. | Unit test |
| FPRIMECFS-CFSROUTER-014 | CfsRouter shall return every buffer on `dataReturnOut` with the context it was received with. | Unit test |
